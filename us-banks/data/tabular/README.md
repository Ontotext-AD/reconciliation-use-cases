# Tabular data for reconciliation

* [national-bank.tsv](national-bank.tsv) contains the tabular data which needs to be reconciled
* [matches.tsv](matches.tsv) is the mapping from the existing entities in the KB and their id (`CHARTER NO`). This information should obviously not be used for reconciliation, only for verifying the corrct result
