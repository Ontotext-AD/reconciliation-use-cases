# Ontotext Reconciliaton Use Cases

This project contains data, configurations and instructions 
for different reconciliation use-cases. 

The use cases are implemented, using [Ontotext Reconciliation](https://github.com/Ontotext-AD/reconciliation),
a tool for matching data using [Ontotext Refine](https://www.ontotext.com/products/ontotext-refine/) to RDF Knowledge Graphs stroed in [Ontotext GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/)

Each folder contains a different use case:
* [us-banks](us-banks): a moderately complex real world scenario 
for matching banks with ambiguous names 
to a knowledge graph, with the help of additional geographical information.
* [star-wars](star-wars): a toy example to get started with the tool.
